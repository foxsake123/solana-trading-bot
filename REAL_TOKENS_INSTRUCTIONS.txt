# Instructions for Using Real Tokens in Simulation Mode

## What was changed:
1. token_scanner.py - Now fetches real tokens from BirdeyeAPI/DexScreener
2. bot_control.json - Enabled use_birdeye_api
3. run_bot_updated.py - Added BirdeyeAPI initialization

## How to verify it's working:
1. Run your bot in simulation mode
2. Check logs for 'Found X real top gainer tokens'
3. Look at trades - no more 'Sim*' addresses
4. All tokens should have real Solana addresses

## If you need to manually update token_analyzer.py:
Find the fetch_token_data method and remove the section that creates fake data for simulation tokens.
Always use self.birdeye_api.get_token_info() to get real data.
