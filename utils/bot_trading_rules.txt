The trading bot implements a multi-layered screening framework to identify potential tokens for trading. Here's a comprehensive overview of the current criteria:

## Core Financial Criteria

   - Minimum liquidity: $250,000
   - This ensures tokens have sufficient market depth to enter and exit positions

2. **Volume Thresholds**
   - Minimum 24-hour trading volume: $50,000
   - Helps filter out inactive tokens with insufficient trading activity

3. **Market Capitalization**
   - Minimum market cap: $500,000
   - Filters out extremely small-cap tokens that may be more prone to manipulation

4. **Holder Count**
   - Minimum holders: 100
   - Protects against tokens concentrated in few wallets

## Momentum & Trend Criteria

5. **Price Movement Thresholds**
   - Minimum 1-hour price change: 5%
   - Minimum 6-hour price change: 10%
   - Minimum 24-hour price change: 20%
   - Bot prioritizes tokens showing consistent upward momentum

## Safety & Quality Measures

6. **Safety Score System**
   - Minimum safety score: 50/100
   - Composite score based on:
     - Liquidity (40% weight)
     - Volume (20% weight)
     - Holder distribution (20% weight)
     - Social media activity (20% weight)

7. **Fake Token Detection**
   - Optional filter for addresses containing "pump" or "moon"
   - Helps avoid common scam tokens

8. **Social Media Analysis**
   - Evaluates Twitter engagement metrics
   - Performs sentiment analysis on related tweets
   - Calculates a social activity score

## Risk Management Parameters

9. **Trading Controls**
   - Take profit target: 1.5x (50% profit)
   - Stop loss: 25% maximum loss
   - Maximum investment per token: 0.1 SOL
   - Moonbag percentage: 15% (portion kept after taking profits)

The bot dynamically evaluates these criteria with each token scan, creating a comprehensive risk profile before executing trades. All parameters are configurable through the dashboard interface.
