# Solana Trading Bot - Fix

This fix addresses issues with Solana connection by creating a compatibility layer
that works with your current library versions. It includes:

1. A compatibility wrapper (solana_wrapper.py)
2. Patches for solana_trader.py and main.py
3. Updated bot_control.json with simulation mode enabled
4. A test script to verify the connection

## How to Test

Run the Solana connection test:

```
python test_solana.py
```

## How to Run

Run your bot with:

```
python core/main.py
```

## Simulation Mode

The bot is currently set to simulation mode for safety.
Once everything is working correctly, you can disable simulation mode
by editing data/bot_control.json and setting "simulation_mode" to false.

## Files Modified

- solana_trader.py: Added compatibility imports
- bot_control.json: Enabled simulation mode

## Files Created

- solana_wrapper.py: Compatibility layer for Solana API
- test_solana.py: Test script for Solana connection
